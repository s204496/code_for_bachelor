# README

There are two directories, the ```Advection```, which contains a notebook for the schemes for the advection equation, and the other directory is ```SWE```, which holds most of the content. Inside this directory is the implementation of each numerical scheme, the data-driven models, the test-cases, the output of programs, and the test-cases used.
